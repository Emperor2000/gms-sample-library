This project showcases functionality for dragging in 2 different ways. 
1. Hold left mouse button on an object to drag it
2. Click on an object with lmb, click elsewhere with rmb and the object will move there.


seperation of concerns: 
1. obj_plane is responsible for moving itself if it has a target position (in situation 1 position is updated from the obj_selector)
2. obj_selector for functionality/situation one, obj_select_and_move for the situation two.
