This project contains a number of small bugs. The code is aimed towards beginning users, yet may look very messy and complicated due to the nature of it's structure.

It is recommended to use this project only for taking a look at seperate mechanics such as firing a weapon, an enemy spotting and attacking the player, etc.

For testing it is recommended to use the interior_test room.
