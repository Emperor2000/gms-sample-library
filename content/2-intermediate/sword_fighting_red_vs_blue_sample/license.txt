You can use the code and sprites for whatever you like. You must remove any reference to me (vincent hendriks, or hendracle interactive) if you do use it. I am not responsible for your project/product in any way shape or form.

YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE ANY AUDIO IN THIS PROJECT, IT IS PURELY AS A REFERENCE!
