This document has the purpose of explaining how you can expand upon this project. 
I have tried to keep everything as simple and clean as possible, although I included some unused demo code.
For example a template of some other weapons in the form of an enum.


This file has been formatted so that you can read it in-engine. If you have any feedback or concerns please contact me.
I do recommend you to read the notes first before contacting.

This tutorial should teach you how to use this template or engine:

Adding a new faction with a fighter:


Let's say you want to add a new faction with it's own fighter and laser weapon.

There is only 1 file you will need to alter:
1. game_manager - add your faction to the "FACTION_TYPE" enum found in the #diplomacy region in the CREATE EVENT.


there are a number of files you will need to create:

fighter:
Create a sprite for the fighter, I recommend you to stick to a naming convention for clarity, for example obj_name, oName, o_name or objName (and spr or s when using sprites).

Create an object for your fighter, duplicate one of the other fighters and edit the values. 
Some values you need to edit are it's faction, the sprite and the script it will use to instantiate lasers or projectiles.

Create a script for creating a laser, duplicate on of the create laser scripts (not the player's) and edit the script name and instance name of the laser it should instantiate.

You may have noticed this won't run, since the laser object has not been added yet.
duplicate one of the LASERS (not the parent) and edit the faction in the create event. You can add a new sprite for the laser and apply it in the projectile's (LASER_YOURFACTION) code.




WARNING:
when creating a new room, make sure to duplicate from room0 to include all the neccesary layers ("Instances", "Projectiles" and "Projectiles2").



Congratulations! You added a new faction with it's very own ship to your project! 
I hope this short guide taught you how to expand this project.
