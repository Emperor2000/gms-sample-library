# gms-sample-library
A library with demo projects to learn Game Maker Studio and Game Maker Language (GML)



**Projects are categorized in multiple difficulty levels:**

1 (beginner) - Small projects / Samples for specific solutions or small game templates.   
2 (beginner-intermediate) - Projects that are slightly longer or code that is a bit more complicated than the beginner level.  
3 (intermediate) - Projects that are significant size.   
4 (advanced) - Reserved for complicated mechanics such as inventory systems, saving, loading, networking, connecting gms to servers, etc.  
  
  
  
Who is this for?
This repository is aimed mostly towards people that do not have a lot of experience with Game Maker. However, that is not to say that there is nothing valuable here for experienced developers. My intention is to create a valuable list of samples that can help anyone with building their solution.
