# gms-sample-library
**A library with sample projects and templates to learn Game Maker Studio and Game Maker Language (GML) with proper code architecture**



**Projects are categorized in multiple difficulty levels:**  
0 (docs) - Used for documentation, guides, UML diagrams and small scripts.  
1 (beginner) - Small projects / Samples for specific solutions or small game templates.   
2 (beginner-intermediate) - Projects that are slightly longer or code that is a bit more complicated than the beginner level.  
3 (intermediate) - Projects that are significant size and may contain slightly challenging topics, such as networking and saving and loading.   
4 (advanced) - Reserved for complicated mechanics such as inventory systems, saving, loading, networking, connecting gms to servers, etc.  
  
  
  
**Who is this for?**
This repository is aimed mostly towards people that do not have a lot of experience with Game Maker. However, that is not to say that there is nothing valuable here for experienced developers. My intention is to create a valuable list of sample projects that can help anyone with building their solution.
